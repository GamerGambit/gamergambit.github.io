Hi, I'm Tyler! I'm an intermediate programmer and game developer who primarily works with Unreal Engine.

I have been programming for approximately a decade, initially starting out in Garry's Mod where I developed gamemodes and addons. Over the years, I have expanded my skills and ventured into creating games and libraries using C++, C#, and Lua, as well as exploring web development with a focus on C#/ASP.NET.

At the moment, I am freelancing to enhance my portfolio and gain more hands-on development experience.
