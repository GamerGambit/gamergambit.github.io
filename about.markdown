Hi, I'm Tyler. I'm a cofounder of [Otway Games](https://otway.games), and and currently am focused on game and tools development working primarily with Unreal Engine.

I have been programming for approximately a decade, initially starting out in Garry's Mod where I developed gamemodes and addons. Over the years, I have expanded my skills and ventured into creating games and libraries using C++, C#, and Lua, as well as exploring web development with a focus on C#/ASP.NET.
